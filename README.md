# 🗺️ U.S. States Game 🇺🇸

A fun interactive geography game built with Python 🐍 and the `turtle` graphics module. Guess all 50 U.S. states and watch them appear on a map as you play!

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

- A blank map of the U.S. is shown.
- You’ll be prompted to guess the name of a U.S. state.
- If correct, the state name appears at the right spot on the map.
- Type `"Exit"` at any time to stop the game.
- A CSV file (`states_to_learn.csv`) will be generated, listing all the states you missed.
